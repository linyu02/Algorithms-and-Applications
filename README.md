This repository includes assignments from (Stat 34560) Fundamentals of Computational Biology: Algorithms and Applications, a graduate-level course focused on real-world applications of algorithms in genomics and systems biology.

These projects demonstrate my ability to apply computational and statistical techniques to real-world problems â€” skills directly relevant to roles in data science and quantitative research.

Job-Relevant Skills: 

-Algorithm Design: Dynamic programming, graph algorithms, optimization

-Statistical Modeling: PCA, Lasso/Ridge regression, classification

-Machine Learning: Deep learning methods for biological data

-Practical Coding: Python-based and R-based implementation of complex methods

-Domain Focus: Genomics, systems biology, and data-driven research
